# Python - Hello, World

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum for learning higher-level programming with Python.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print()`
- How to work with strings and use slicing
- What indexing and slicing are in Python
- The basics of Python coding style (PEP8/pycodestyle)
- How to run Python scripts and make them executable

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- All scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code checked with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- Files must be executable

| `2-print.py`          | Prints a fixed string using `print()`            |
| `3-print_number.py`   | Prints an integer using f-strings                |
| `4-print_float.py`    | Prints a float with 2 decimal places using f-strings |
| `5-print_string.py`   | Prints a string 3 times, then the first 9 characters |
| `6-concat.py`         | Concatenates two strings with an additional phrase |
| `7-edges.py`          | Demonstrates slicing: first 3, last 2, and middle of a word |
| `8-concat_edges.py`   | Constructs a new sentence using parts of predefined strings |
| `9-easter_egg.py`     | Prints The Zen of Python using a special module  |

## How to run

Make all scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x *.py
